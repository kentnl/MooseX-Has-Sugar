 [Bugs]
 - Fixed use of a Test::Builder method that is going away. Thanks to Schwern for reporting and providing the patch.

 [Dependencies::Changed]
 - build requires : Module::Build 0.3601 -> 0.4002
 - configure requires : Module::Build 0.3601 -> 0.4002
 - develop recommends : Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::KENTNL::Lite 0.01009803 -> v1.3.0
 - develop suggests : Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::KENTNL v1.2.0 -> v1.4.3
 - test requires : Test::More 0.88 -> 0.98

 [TODO]
 - Thinking of adding Moo support of some kind, but Moo is notedly different. Esp: lazy/lazy_build.
 - I considered making a Moo-style-for-Moose version, but then considered that implementing 'lazy' would have to know what the attribute was called to set the respective Moose builder value, so that is Too Hard. 
 - Please, if you're reading this and have suggestions/feedback, feel free to hit me up on IRC =).
